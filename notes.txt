daemon mode:
- ignores most other flags
- uses platform's default system utmpx file locations (maybe also allow different paths like above)
- gets signal from client, then attempts to read uid and remove entries for that user (will/should use Unix Domain Socket later on)
- writes PID to runfs (e.g. /run/utxghost/utxghost.pid)
- should complain at launch if it's not running with group utmp
